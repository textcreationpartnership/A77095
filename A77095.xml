            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A WICKED PLOT AGAINST The Perſon of Sir WILLIAM WALLER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Doubt not but you have heard of our Siedge at Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell Caſtle, but in regard I am not ignorant how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain reports of this nature are at London, I am bold to preſent you with a brief (yet true Relation) both of the whole Siedge, and the yeilding up of the ſaid Caſtle to Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> on Twelfe-day laſt in the morning.</p>
            <p>At our firſt ſitting down before the Town and Caſtle of Arundell, the Cavaliers ſhewed themſelves very bold and inſolent, &amp; ſeemed to be ſo confident of their own ſtrength that they took the offer of quarter in defiance, &amp; hung out their red flag, but within halfe an houres fight the enemy was forced from their Out-workes, and above eighty of them taken priſoners, the reſt we purſued into the Town, who without any further oppoſition fled into the Caſtle for ſhelter, and the ſtreets were quickly ſcoured by our Forlorn Hope, and one Captain and a Lieutenant with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other priſoners taken.</p>
            <p>The Town being thus cleered of the Enemy and wonne by our men, the Cavaliers played out of the Caſtle with
<pb facs="tcp:152850:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>musket ſhot, but could command but very little of the Town; for the greateſt annoyance they did us by ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, was on the Bridge, where one of our men was ſhot in the thigh, and Captain <hi>Butler</hi> ſcapt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrowly, for he was ſhot thorow the Holſter as he rode over.</p>
            <p>It pleaſed God that we loſt not above three or foure men (to my beſt knowledge) in entering the Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſome few that were wounded, of which number I muſt with ſorrow remember that valiant Gentleman Lieutenant Collonell <hi>Ramſey,</hi> who was killled, and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Collonell <hi>Burcher,</hi> who received a wound in the belly, but is pretty well recovered of it againe, and our chiefe Engineer was taken priſoner.</p>
            <p>In the taking of this Towne (which is by nature ſcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in a place of great advantage, and was fortified by the Enemy) I may not forget the undanted courage of our men, and eſpecially the blew coats, who run up the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies workes, and beat them off with the but ends of their muskets: and indeed, to ſpeak the truth, thoſe men which we took at <hi>Alton</hi> that ioyned with us, did very good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Yet in this place I cannot omit to acquaint you of a perfidious raſcall, that for hire or ſome other wicked end, would have killed our Noble Generall, and not certainly knowing his perſon, gave fire at the Sergeant Maior Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; but it pleaſed God that his Musket went not off, ſo that his wicked deſigne was prevented, and himſelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly hanged.</p>
            <p>The greateſt part of our foot were quartered in the town and a Regiment of Horſe kept a guard, that not onely all manner of reliefe might be kept from the Caſtle, but
<pb facs="tcp:152850:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>alſo to prevent their ſallying forth, which within three dayes they attempted to do, but were quickly driven in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with loſſe.</p>
            <p>And after that they turned forth of the Caſtle about a hundred horſe into a Medow, part of which was within Musket ſhot of the Caſtle, and yet moſt of them were quickly gotten out by our men.</p>
            <p>Some of their men being hunger-bitten, got over the Walles and ſlid downe with Ropes and were taken priſoners.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Richard Smith</hi> eſcaped about foure miles out of Towne, that came out of the Caſtle, and was taken at one of our Courts of Guard, where being by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Guard very ſtrictly examined, he confeſſed, that he was ſent with a Letter to Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> for ayde, but would not produce the Letter, but ſaid that he had loſt it: So that it appearing that he had beene an arch Spie in our Army, and was now going to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray it into the hands of the Enemy, he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be hanged upon the Bridge in the view of the Caſtle.</p>
            <p>But we were much troubled, and did greatly feare leſt that ſome of the chiefe of their Commanders had eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the Caſtle, for the laſt Week was found (by ſome of our ſoldiers) upon the River which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth near to the Eaſt ſide of the Caſtle, a Boate made of Horſe Hides, which was brought from the Caſtle, and it is a great preſumption, that ſome uſe was made thereof; but it is rather thought that it conveyed ſome Meſſenger away to Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> then that any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders eſcaped.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152850:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> Much talke we had of <hi>Hoptons</hi> comming, for divers dayes together, and ſome of our Scouts did affirme that they ſaw ſome of his Scouts and were near his body, but we heard no more of him untill VVedneſday laſt, at which time news was brought that he had beſieged VVaberton Houſe about ſixe miles from Chicheſter, in which is a Garriſon of about eighty men under the Command of Collonel <hi>Norton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon Friday laſt a Drummer came forth of the Caſtle for a parley, but ſeeing great ſtore of Proviſion in our Army, and having been hunger-bitten in the Caſtle, he yeilded himſelf priſoner rather then to carry an anſwer back into the Caſtle, ſo that they were conſtrained to ſend another, and a Parley was granted, but in regard they would not accept of Sir <hi>Williams</hi> free proffer of quarter at his firſt comming, he now utterly refuſed to give them any, but would have them ſubmit to his mercy. The Lady <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi> and many other Gentle women of quality came out of the Caſtle: And the next morning being on Twelfe day laſt, the Caſtle was ſurrendred upon quarter, but all of them were to become priſoners; of which there was about eight hundred Common ſoldiers, and about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Commanders, of which the chiefeſt were Sir <hi>Edward Biſhop,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Ford,</hi> Collonell <hi>Banfield,</hi> Lieutenant Collonell <hi>Rolles,</hi> Major <hi>Maſſey,</hi> and Major <hi>Mullins,</hi> who are all very ſuddainly to be ſent up to the City of London.</p>
            <p>It was my chance to be at Arundell at the very inſtant when the Caſtle was yeilded, and ſaw the Priſoners march out, but I never ſaw ſo many weake and feeble creatures together in my life, for almoſt all the Common ſouldiers
<pb facs="tcp:152850:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>were halfe ſtarved, and many of them hardly able to ſet one foot before another. Yet had they Beefe very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but they certified us, that they had no bread ſince Chriſtmas day. There were great ſtore of Horſe, armes, and much treaſure found in the Caſtle: So that it is not a little weakening to the Enemy, and ſtrengthening to our Partie.</p>
            <p>The taking of this place hath wonderfully encouraged our men, who are all ſo forward in their ſervice that they deſerve great commendations, and the Lord I hope will proſper all their undertakings.</p>
            <p>VVithin a day or two after the taking of the ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, there fell out a fortunate adventure, no leſſe remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable then all the reſt. A man of VVarre of Holland had chaſed a Dunkirk Ship laden with good ſtore of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and linnen Cloth, which is now very welcome to our Army.</p>
            <p>She had in her twenty four pieces of Braſſe Ordnance, about a hundred Barrels of Powder, good ſtore of Armes, which (according to the Ordinary cuſtome of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this kinde) was conceived and believed to be ſent to the relief of the Engliſh-Iriſh, that make havocke now in Cheſhire.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> Boarded the Ship, which came up the Channell not farre from Arundell Caſtle, on Tueſday laſt, and is now Maſter of it.</p>
            <p>He hath alſo ſent two thouſand horſe and foot, with two Drakes, to beſiedge the Lord <hi>Lumleys</hi> houſe in Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex, the taking of which will be of great advantage to us, and it is thought, by the moſt juditious Commanders, that it cannot long hold out.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152850:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> This being done our Noble Generall, as we heare, intends to loſe no time, but having received the additions of the London Trained Bands into his Army, he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to march VVeſtwards, from whence we underſtand there are conſiderable ſupplyes comming to the relief of Sir <hi>Ralph Hoptan:</hi> And it is hoped that Redding, VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford, and ſome other Townes thereabouts will ſoon be brought to ſubjection.</p>
            <p>VVhich I pray to the Lord they may in his due time, to his glory; and that he would be pleaſed to ſend a period to theſe troubles. VVhich is the continuall prayer of him who is</p>
