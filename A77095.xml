            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A WICKED PLOT AGAINST The Per≈øon of Sir WILLIAM WALLER.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Doubt not but you have heard of our Siedge at Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell Ca≈øtle, but in regard I am not ignorant how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain reports of this nature are at London, I am bold to pre≈øent you with a brief (yet true Relation) both of the whole Siedge, and the yeilding up of the ≈øaid Ca≈øtle to Sir <hi>William Waller</hi> on Twelfe-day la≈øt in the morning.</p>
            <p>At our fir≈øt ≈øitting down before the Town and Ca≈øtle of Arundell, the Cavaliers ≈øhewed them≈øelves very bold and in≈øolent, &amp; ≈øeemed to be ≈øo confident of their own ≈øtrength that they took the offer of quarter in defiance, &amp; hung out their red flag, but within halfe an houres fight the enemy was forced from their Out-workes, and above eighty of them taken pri≈øoners, the re≈øt we pur≈øued into the Town, who without any further oppo≈øition fled into the Ca≈øtle for ≈øhelter, and the ≈øtreets were quickly ≈øcoured by our Forlorn Hope, and one Captain and a Lieutenant with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other pri≈øoners taken.</p>
            <p>The Town being thus cleered of the Enemy and wonne by our men, the Cavaliers played out of the Ca≈øtle with
<pb facs="tcp:152850:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>musket ≈øhot, but could command but very little of the Town; for the greate≈øt annoyance they did us by ≈øhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from thence, was on the Bridge, where one of our men was ≈øhot in the thigh, and Captain <hi>Butler</hi> ≈øcapt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry narrowly, for he was ≈øhot thorow the Hol≈øter as he rode over.</p>
            <p>It plea≈øed God that we lo≈øt not above three or foure men (to my be≈øt knowledge) in entering the Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides ≈øome few that were wounded, of which number I mu≈øt with ≈øorrow remember that valiant Gentleman Lieutenant Collonell <hi>Ram≈øey,</hi> who was killled, and Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Collonell <hi>Burcher,</hi> who received a wound in the belly, but is pretty well recovered of it againe, and our chiefe Engineer was taken pri≈øoner.</p>
            <p>In the taking of this Towne (which is by nature ≈øcitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in a place of great advantage, and was fortified by the Enemy) I may not forget the undanted courage of our men, and e≈øpecially the blew coats, who run up the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies workes, and beat them off with the but ends of their muskets: and indeed, to ≈øpeak the truth, tho≈øe men which we took at <hi>Alton</hi> that ioyned with us, did very good ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>Yet in this place I cannot omit to acquaint you of a perfidious ra≈øcall, that for hire or ≈øome other wicked end, would have killed our Noble Generall, and not certainly knowing his per≈øon, gave fire at the Sergeant Maior Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; but it plea≈øed God that his Musket went not off, ≈øo that his wicked de≈øigne was prevented, and him≈øelfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervedly hanged.</p>
            <p>The greate≈øt part of our foot were quartered in the town and a Regiment of Hor≈øe kept a guard, that not onely all manner of reliefe might be kept from the Ca≈øtle, but
<pb facs="tcp:152850:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>al≈øo to prevent their ≈øallying forth, which within three dayes they attempted to do, but were quickly driven in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain with lo≈ø≈øe.</p>
            <p>And after that they turned forth of the Ca≈øtle about a hundred hor≈øe into a Medow, part of which was within Musket ≈øhot of the Ca≈øtle, and yet mo≈øt of them were quickly gotten out by our men.</p>
            <p>Some of their men being hunger-bitten, got over the Walles and ≈ølid downe with Ropes and were taken pri≈øoners.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Richard Smith</hi> e≈øcaped about foure miles out of Towne, that came out of the Ca≈øtle, and was taken at one of our Courts of Guard, where being by the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Guard very ≈øtrictly examined, he confe≈ø≈øed, that he was ≈øent with a Letter to Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton</hi> for ayde, but would not produce the Letter, but ≈øaid that he had lo≈øt it: So that it appearing that he had beene an arch Spie in our Army, and was now going to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray it into the hands of the Enemy, he was condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be hanged upon the Bridge in the view of the Ca≈øtle.</p>
            <p>But we were much troubled, and did greatly feare le≈øt that ≈øome of the chiefe of their Commanders had e≈øca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped out of the Ca≈øtle, for the la≈øt Week was found (by ≈øome of our ≈øoldiers) upon the River which run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth near to the Ea≈øt ≈øide of the Ca≈øtle, a Boate made of Hor≈øe Hides, which was brought from the Ca≈øtle, and it is a great pre≈øumption, that ≈øome u≈øe was made thereof; but it is rather thought that it conveyed ≈øome Me≈ø≈øenger away to Sir <hi>Ralph Hopton,</hi> then that any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders e≈øcaped.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152850:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> Much talke we had of <hi>Hoptons</hi> comming, for divers dayes together, and ≈øome of our Scouts did affirme that they ≈øaw ≈øome of his Scouts and were near his body, but we heard no more of him untill VVedne≈øday la≈øt, at which time news was brought that he had be≈øieged VVaberton Hou≈øe about ≈øixe miles from Chiche≈øter, in which is a Garri≈øon of about eighty men under the Command of Collonel <hi>Norton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vpon Friday la≈øt a Drummer came forth of the Ca≈øtle for a parley, but ≈øeeing great ≈øtore of Provi≈øion in our Army, and having been hunger-bitten in the Ca≈øtle, he yeilded him≈øelf pri≈øoner rather then to carry an an≈øwer back into the Ca≈øtle, ≈øo that they were con≈øtrained to ≈øend another, and a Parley was granted, but in regard they would not accept of Sir <hi>Williams</hi> free proffer of quarter at his fir≈øt comming, he now utterly refu≈øed to give them any, but would have them ≈øubmit to his mercy. The Lady <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhop</hi> and many other Gentle women of quality came out of the Ca≈øtle: And the next morning being on Twelfe day la≈øt, the Ca≈øtle was ≈øurrendred upon quarter, but all of them were to become pri≈øoners; of which there was about eight hundred Common ≈øoldiers, and about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty Commanders, of which the chiefe≈øt were Sir <hi>Edward Bi≈øhop,</hi> Sir <hi>Edward Ford,</hi> Collonell <hi>Banfield,</hi> Lieutenant Collonell <hi>Rolles,</hi> Major <hi>Ma≈ø≈øey,</hi> and Major <hi>Mullins,</hi> who are all very ≈øuddainly to be ≈øent up to the City of London.</p>
            <p>It was my chance to be at Arundell at the very in≈øtant when the Ca≈øtle was yeilded, and ≈øaw the Pri≈øoners march out, but I never ≈øaw ≈øo many weake and feeble creatures together in my life, for almo≈øt all the Common ≈øouldiers
<pb facs="tcp:152850:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>were halfe ≈øtarved, and many of them hardly able to ≈øet one foot before another. Yet had they Beefe very plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, but they certified us, that they had no bread ≈øince Chri≈øtmas day. There were great ≈øtore of Hor≈øe, armes, and much trea≈øure found in the Ca≈øtle: So that it is not a little weakening to the Enemy, and ≈øtrengthening to our Partie.</p>
            <p>The taking of this place hath wonderfully encouraged our men, who are all ≈øo forward in their ≈øervice that they de≈øerve great commendations, and the Lord I hope will pro≈øper all their undertakings.</p>
            <p>VVithin a day or two after the taking of the ≈øaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtle, there fell out a fortunate adventure, no le≈ø≈øe remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable then all the re≈øt. A man of VVarre of Holland had cha≈øed a Dunkirk Ship laden with good ≈øtore of Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize and linnen Cloth, which is now very welcome to our Army.</p>
            <p>She had in her twenty four pieces of Bra≈ø≈øe Ordnance, about a hundred Barrels of Powder, good ≈øtore of Armes, which (according to the Ordinary cu≈øtome of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this kinde) was conceived and believed to be ≈øent to the relief of the Engli≈øh-Iri≈øh, that make havocke now in Che≈øhire.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>William</hi> Boarded the Ship, which came up the Channell not farre from Arundell Ca≈øtle, on Tue≈øday la≈øt, and is now Ma≈øter of it.</p>
            <p>He hath al≈øo ≈øent two thou≈øand hor≈øe and foot, with two Drakes, to be≈øiedge the Lord <hi>Lumleys</hi> hou≈øe in Su≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øex, the taking of which will be of great advantage to us, and it is thought, by the mo≈øt juditious Commanders, that it cannot long hold out.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:152850:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> This being done our Noble Generall, as we heare, intends to lo≈øe no time, but having received the additions of the London Trained Bands into his Army, he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to march VVe≈øtwards, from whence we under≈øtand there are con≈øiderable ≈øupplyes comming to the relief of Sir <hi>Ralph Hoptan:</hi> And it is hoped that Redding, VVal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford, and ≈øome other Townes thereabouts will ≈øoon be brought to ≈øubjection.</p>
            <p>VVhich I pray to the Lord they may in his due time, to his glory; and that he would be plea≈øed to ≈øend a period to the≈øe troubles. VVhich is the continuall prayer of him who is</p>
